## Identity

This repo is **claude-bridge** — part of the [sovereign-shovels](../README.md) portfolio.

- **Substrate anchor:** Claude
- **Utility category:** bridge
- **Tagline:** Shared context bus. What you copy in Cursor is what Claude Desktop sees. What you select in your terminal is what your IDE knows.
- **Sprint:** deferred (high build cost, validate via miner first)
- **Estimated build for v0.1:** 5–8 weeks for v0.1 — high build cost is the main risk

The substrate this shovel rides is: Claude Desktop + Cursor + terminal users who want shared context

The launch channels are: r/ClaudeAI, r/cursor, AI Twitter, HN

## Philosophy this repo lives by

Read the universal philosophy: [[../PHILOSOPHY|Philosophy]].

In short, every shovel must satisfy all five rules:

1. **Substrate-anchored name** ✓ (this is `claude-bridge`)
2. **Sovereign by construction** — user owns model choice, BYO endpoint, must work with local-only
3. **Real demand evidence** — gap is documented, not assumed
4. **Buildable in 1–3 weeks** — v0.1 estimate is 5–8 weeks for v0.1 — high build cost is the main risk
5. **Scope-evolution headroom** — see PRD-v1 for v0.1 → v0.5 → v1.0

## STRICT NO-NOS — do not violate any of these

### Universal (inherited from [[../NO-NOS|NO-NOS]])

1. NO hardcoded API keys, vendor URLs, or model names in code outside config files.
2. NO default that requires a sign-up upstream. Tool must work with a local model.
3. NO telemetry, phone-home, or analytics by default.
4. NO closed-source runtime dependencies that compromise sovereignty.
5. NO scope creep into "agent platform" or "general assistant" territory.
6. NO fake claims of being official upstream tooling.
7. NO breaking config changes in v0.x without printed migration path.
8. NO maintenance promises in README. "Best-effort community shovel."
9. NO PRs merged without working tests.
10. NO publishing v1.0 without PRD-v1 acceptance criteria met.

### Specific to claude-bridge

1. Default privacy mode: nothing leaves the local machine.
2. Never broadcast clipboard contents that match common secret patterns (API keys, .env values).
3. Subscribers must explicitly request context types — no firehose.

### Anti-scope (what NOT to build, ever, in this repo)

Not a clipboard manager. Not a snippet store. Not a productivity suite. Context-bus only.

## How to operate here

When you (the agent) start work in this repo:

1. **Read** [[PRD-v1]] before writing any code.
2. **Read** [[../PHILOSOPHY|Philosophy]] and [[../NO-NOS|NO-NOS]] if you haven't this session.
3. **Update** [[progress]] after each significant change. Update the YAML
   frontmatter — the root [[../PORTFOLIO]] view aggregates from it.
4. **If a decision conflicts with this AGENTS.md**, STOP and ask the human.
5. **If a user asks for something that violates a no-no**, push back. Don't comply.
6. **Commits** follow conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.).
7. **Branches**: `main` is protected. Work on `feat/<thing>` branches and PR.
8. **Tests** are required for any code path that ships in v0.1.

## Tombstone watch

What could kill this shovel:

Low. Nobody owns this.

What we're watching for:

Cross-OS robustness is genuinely hard. May get killed by complexity, not competition.

If the kill signal triggers, notify the human before taking further action.
