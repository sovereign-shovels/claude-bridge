## What this is

Shared context bus. What you copy in Cursor is what Claude Desktop sees. What you select in your terminal is what your IDE knows.

## What this isn't

Not a clipboard manager. Not a snippet store. Not a productivity suite.

## Install

> Coming with v0.1 release.

## Configure

You bring the model. By default `claude-bridge` tries to use a local provider:

- For LLM endpoints: Ollama at `http://localhost:11434`
- For voice endpoints: configurable, see [docs/configure.md]

To use any other provider (Claude, GPT, Hermes, OpenRouter, Sarvam, etc.):

```toml
# ~/.config/claude-bridge/config.toml
[provider]
endpoint = "https://api.your-provider.com/v1"
api_key_env = "YOUR_PROVIDER_KEY"
model = "your-model-name"
```

Anthropic, OpenAI, and Sarvam endpoints all work. Local Ollama, llama.cpp,
LM Studio, and vLLM all work via their OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Why this exists

Claude Desktop knows what you're saying. Cursor knows what you're editing. Your terminal knows what you just selected. None of them know about the others. claude-bridge is a local context bus: a daemon that broadcasts clipboard, active selection, and recent files over a local socket so subscribers can pull the right context.
